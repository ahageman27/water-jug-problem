# The Water Jug Problem

This is a final project from CS2 atr MSU Denver. It solves the classic water jug problem in which you are given two jugs of different sizes with no markings to allow measurements of smaller quantities and are tasked with finding an amount of water less than the amount of the largest jug. 

I solved this problem by creating a graph of all possible positions of the two jugs and then doing a breadth first search to find the desired amount of water. 

This is a command line application that requires a python interpreter to run.
